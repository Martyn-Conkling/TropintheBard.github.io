I have a confession to make.  
Sometimes, I procrastinate. 
I procrastinate primarily because of anxiety about work:

Will I be able to understand new concepts?
Will I be able to remember the new material?
Will I be able to remember the programming syntax?
Will I be making progress fast enough....


You get the picture.  
Sometimes I procrastinate because I am distracted, or mentally preoccupied with other projects, ideas, or anxieties.
Mostly anxieties.  

So how do I beat my anxieties?
Every time I have successfully beaten my anxiety and gotten quality and quantity work done, I have first taken 5 minutes to write down every little thing that is on my mind, big and small, and then save the file for the date, making sure to put the major things I need to do on my daily to do list document.  Then I forget about all that little stuff, and I can focus.

The key to beating procrastination is to set achievable daily goals, and then just sit down and do them.  

So I set the goal, and then begin to do it.

Today I successfully did this. 
Tomorrow I will do the same.
